A DAO is a digital organization or corporation run by a set of rules encoded as computer programs on a
blockchain, rather than by traditional management structures. The rules and transactions are maintained
by a decentralized network of computers, making it resistant to censorship, fraud, and control by any single
entity. Members of a DAO use blockchain-based tokens to vote on proposals and make decisions
collectively.
